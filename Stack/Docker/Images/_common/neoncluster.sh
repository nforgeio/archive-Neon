# This script defines various constants that may be useful for NeonCluster containers.
# Containers that requires these should:
#
#   1. have their [build.ps1] script copy this file from the 
#      ["$env:NR_ROOT\\Stack\\Docker\\Images"] directory to the build
#      home directory.
#
#   2. Have the Dockerfile copy the file to the container's root folder.
#
#   3. Have Git ignore the copied file.
#
#   4. Have [docker-entrypoint.sh] run the script like: . \neoncluster.sh
