# This is a template of the docker image definition file to be used to generate
# a modified Elasticsearch image based on a specific official version of the
# ElasticSearch image.  This image includes:
#
#   * A custom entry point script that loads environment variables and other
#     settings via the mounted [/etc/neoncluster/env-host] and
#     [/etc/neoncluster/env-host] files.
#
#   * Elasticsearch X-PACK plugins.
#
# This file cannot be used directly to create an image.  The [build.ps1] script 
# generates a suitable dockerfile by replacing "${VERSION}" with the desired
# version and then building the image.
#
#   ${VERSION}      - The Elasticsearch version (e.g. "5.0.1")
#
# You need to specify the following environment variables when running the 
# container (these are referenced by the [elasticsearch.yml] configuration file):
#
#   ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER         - (required) Identifies the Elasticsearch cluster
#   ELASTICSEARCH_TCP_PORT        - (required) Inter-node TCP communication ports
#   ELASTICSEARCH_HTTP_PORT       - (required) HTTP API port
#   ELASTICSEARCH_NODE_MASTER     - (optional) Indicates that this is eligible to be a master
#                                   Defaults to [true].
#   ELASTICSEARCH_NODE_DATA       - (optional) Indicates that this node will host data vs.
#                                   being a dedicated master or just a router
#                                   Defaults to [true].
#   ELASTICSEARCH_QUORUM          - (required) Minimum number of master nodes to be
#                                   present for the cluster to be considered
#                                   healthy.
#   ELASTICSEARCH_BOOTSTRAP_NODES - (required) A comma separated list of one or more IP 
#                                   addresses or DNS names of nodes that will be used 
#                                   for bootstrapping the Elasticsearch cluster.
#
# The Docker data volume must be mounted at:
#
#       /mnt/esdata
