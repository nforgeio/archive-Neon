# This is called when the container starts and then whenever the CONFIG_KEY is 
# is modified in Consul.  A JSON record detailing the change (like that depicted
# below) will be passed as STDIN:
#
#   {
#       "Key": "foo/bar/baz",
#       "CreateIndex": 1793,
#       "ModifyIndex": 1793,
#       "LockIndex": 0,
#       "Flags": 0,
#       "Value": "aGV5",
#       "Session": ""
#   }
#
# Note that we don't actually need to parse this for this scenario because all we
# need is to know is that the configuration key was modified.

# We'll detect whether we're starting HAProxy for the first time or an existing 
# instance is to be restarted.
#
# NOTE: The script will return a non-zero exit code if there are any errors
#       starting HAProxy for the first time (ultimately terminating the container).
#       Errors will be logged when restarting but we'll leave an existing HAProxy 
#       running with the old configuration for resiliency and will fork a script 
#       that will  periodically log warnings while the proxy is out-of-date.
