# Verifies that a specific Vault backend is healthy and ready for traffic.  This is
# called peridocially by HAProxy to add or remove instances from rotation.  See the
# detailed HAProxy documentation for more information:
#
#       http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html#external-check%20command
#
# HAProxy will call this passing the following arguments:
#
#       <proxy_address> <proxy_port> <server_address> <server_port>
#
# This script actually ignores these and used the backend name passed in the
# HAPROXY_SERVER_NAME as the hostname of the instance and HAPROXY_SERVER_PORT
# as the service port.  HAPROXY_SERVER_NAME is set to an host name like
# [manage-0.neon-vault.cluster] in the HAProxy config file.
#
# The script returns 0 if the endpoint is ready, non-zero if it's unavailable or sealed.
#
# NOTE: This relies on [/etc/neoncluster/env-host] being mounted and that it
#       adds the vault instance host definitions to the container's [/etc/hosts].
