# This Fluentd filter plugin sets the record's [level] field one of the log 
# level strings below, by examining one or more of the record's fields:
#
#		emergency	System is unusable (not emitted by services).
#		alert		System is seriously degraded (not emitted by services)..
#		critical	Service has failed (maps from fatal for Log4Net oriented application logging).
#		error		Service has encountered an error.
#		warn		Indicates that an error may occur if actions are not taken.
#		notice		Something unusual has occurred but is not an error.
#		info		Normal operational messages that require no action.
#		debug		Developer/diagnostic information.
#		unknown		Log level could not be determined.
#
# The current implementation tries the following:
#
#		* If the [PRIORITY] field exists then it is assumed to be a SYSLOG/JOURNAL
#		  log level code.
#
#		* If the [message] field exists and starts with a pattern like:
#
#				/^\s*\[\s*(.*)\s*\]\s*/
#
#		  where the matched group is a known log level string, then the
#		  level string will be mapped to one of the standard levels.  Note
#		  that the entire pattern will be stripped from the [message] field.
#
#		* [level] will be set to [other] if the level couldn't be determined.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
# This filter is intended to work in conjunction with other filters to parse
# and then strip fields from the beginning of the message string.  For this
# to work properly, you'll need to stream events through following filters
# in the order below:
#
#		neon-docker
#		neon-timestamp
#		neon-loglevel
#		neon-logfields
