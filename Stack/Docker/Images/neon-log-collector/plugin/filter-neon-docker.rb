# This Fluentd filter plugin detects container logs forwarded by Docker and 
# normalizes the properties for the events detected.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
# This filter is intended to work in conjunction with other filters to parse
# and then strip fields from the beginning of the message string.  For this
# to work properly, you'll need to stream events through following filters
# in the order below:
#
#		neon-docker
#		neon-timestamp
#		neon-loglevel
#		neon-logfields

require 'fluent/filter'

				return record;	# Not from Docker
			end

			record["service_host"] = "docker";

			# Copy[log] to [message], trimming any whitespace.

			record["message"] = record["log"].strip;

			# Set [service] to the container name, stripping off the leading
		    # forward slash and everything from the first period to the end
            # of the string.
