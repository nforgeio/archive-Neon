# This Fluentd filter plugin that attempts to extract the best timestamp for
# a log event by looking for a recognized time format within at the beginning
# of the log message.  The Fluentd event time will be used if the the message
# didn't include a valid time.
#
# Recognized timestamps will be stripped from the message.
#
# Message timestamps must appear at the beginning of the message and may or
# may not be embedded within square brackets [...].  The plugin recognizes
# the following date formats:
#
#		2000-01-22 16:30:22 +0000
#		2000-01-22 16:30:22
#       2000-01-22T16:30:22.999
#       2000-01-22T16:30:22.999Z
#		2000-01-22T16:30:22.999GMT
#       2000-01-22T16:30:22+0000
#       2000-01-22T16:30:22+00:00
#       2000-01-22T16:30:22.999+00:00
#
# Note that we'll also parse commas as well as periods for the optional 
# fractional seconds.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
# This filter is intended to work in conjunction with other filters to parse
# and then strip fields from the beginning of the message string.  For this
# to work properly, you'll need to stream events through following filters
# in the order below:
#
#		neon-docker
#		neon-timestamp
#		neon-loglevel
#		neon-logfields
